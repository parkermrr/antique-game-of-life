-Xint: 
    Runs the application in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code is disabled, and all bytecode is executed by the interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the just-in-time (JIT) compiler aren't present in this mode.

-Xnoclassgc: 
    Disables garbage collection (GC) of classes

-XX:+UseSerialGC
    Enables the use of the serial garbage collector. This is generally the best choice for small and simple applications that don't require any special functionality from garbage collection. By default, this option is disabled and the default collector is used.

-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -Xms4m -Xmx4m 
    Requests the VM to touch every page on the Java heap after requesting it from the operating system and before handing memory out to the application. By default, this option is disabled and all pages are committed as the application uses the heap space. 
    Limited heap size to 4MBytes. Small heap size ressults in more frequent GC cycles, leading to higher CPU usage and potential performance slowdowns.
